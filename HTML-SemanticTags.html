Question: What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?
Answer:
Non-semantic tags don't inherently describe the content they contain. They provide no information about the meaning or structure of the content enclosed within them.
Semantic tags clearly define the contentâ€™s purpose and structure. They provide meaning to the content enclosed, both to the browser and to developers.

Question: What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags?
Answer:
Semantic tags provide meaning to the web content, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to navigate and interpret the information.
Using semantic tags makes the HTML code more readable and meaningful to developers.
