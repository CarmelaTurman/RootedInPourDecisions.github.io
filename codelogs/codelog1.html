Question: What is the difference between non-semantic and semantic tags in HTML?
Answer:

	Semantic tags clearly define the purpose and structure of the content. They provide meaning to the content enclosed, both to the browser and to developers. 
	Non-semantic tags don't inherently describe the content they contain. They provide no information about the meaning or structure of the content enclosed within them.
 
                
	Question: Question: What are two (or more) benefits of using semantic tags? 
    Answer:

		Semantic tags provide meaning to the web content, making it easier for screen readers and other assistive technologies to navigate and interpret the information.</li>
		Using semantic tags makes the HTML code more readable and meaningful to developers.</li>
